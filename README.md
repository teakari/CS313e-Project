**PROJECT OVERVIEW**



GENERAL IDEA

Webscrapes RateMyProfessor website for UT Austin professors and ranks them by score.
Can be filtered by the major each professor teaches. I also plan to allow scores to be looked up
by typing in a professor's last name or to output a list of professors ranked by their score
given a certain major.



DATASETS

Datasets will be generated by the webscraping code and stored as a .csv file to be analyzed by the
main portion of the code. This is because ratings constantly change with each new review, so the 
dataset can't stay stagnant.



METHODS & LIBRARIES

The main packages I will be using for this are Selenium to webscrape RMP and Pandas to create the .csv
file.

In order to be able to rank the professors by their scores, I plan on using a priority queue data structure
paired with a max heap for this. I also intend to use a hash table to store the data that will be extracted from the 
web scraping (score out of 5, name, difficulty, department, total amount of ratings). However, if I am unable to do this,
I'd likely store the data in a dictionary.

Some classes I would include (but are not limited to) are the max_heap class that includes heapify in the case where I want
extract the highest n scores and a hash table class that includes double hashing in case the keys clash.
As for functions, I plan to implement a main home screen that the user can interact with.
They have the option to return the top n professors in UT (regardless of their department), filter it so that it shows the top n 
for the specified department, return a list of professors in a specified department along with their scores, return a top n list
of professors in a specific department based on their difficulty, search up a professor by name and see their score, difficulty, department, etc, and any more (or less depending on how laborous it is) if I am able to handle it.
Any professors with a total number of ratings equating to zero won't be included in the final dataset (for good reasons). I'd
also discard any professor scores if they have less than 10-15 reviews since their ratings are likely to be skewed.



TEST CASES

In order to test the correctness of the software, I would ensure that all the data values are correct for the professor
and that the hash table is storing the data in the correct bucket (or once again, if I use a dictionary that each key and value are
matched properly). I'd probably cross-check RMP ratings and values with the value generated in the .csv to make sure the web scraper
was successful.

As for test cases created from unittesting, it'll be more challenging to develop since this project depends on webscraping and
calling the data in an easier-to-access way.



EXPECTATIONS

For now, I expect the software to be very elementary since it's only able to generate rankings and organize the data by the values
obtained. However, I do expect the ranking to be accurate, especially if a handful of professors get 5's across the board. However,
this only tends to UT Austin professors, and since RMP isn't an official university website, the amount of professors on there
is dependent on the students who write reviews for them, so there will be many professors who are not included in the dataset.

Also, RMP scores are not the most accurate indication of how "good" a professor truly is since everyone is entitled to their
own opinions and experiences. That being said, RMP tags a number onto these professors, and that is what I'm going to be analyzing
and sorting through. Consider this my little disclaimer.
